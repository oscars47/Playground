# @ oscars47
# problem description: how many integers from 1 to 100 can you form using the digits of the year (e.g., 2023)
#                       exactly once each along eith the operators + - * / and ^ (exponentiate).
#                       preference for fewer operations; with the same number of operations prefer the order of the year.
